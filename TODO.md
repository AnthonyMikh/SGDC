# TODO
* [ ] Add insert functions for binary tree (seriously, that's essential)
* [ ] Make impossible to use `SGDC_SIMPLE_DATATYPE` more than once
* [ ] Add usable documentation (possibly generated from comments in source code)
* [ ] Add an option for bintree to count subnodes
* [ ] Add an option for bintree to hold `T*` rather than `T`. That will ease using data structures with pointers (no manual allocation and freeing)
* [ ] Add binary search tree both plain and complicated variants (red-black, AVL)
* [ ] Add more different data structures
  * [ ] Linked list
  * [ ] Double-linked list
  * _And others_
