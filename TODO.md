# TODO
* [ ] Add insert functions for binary tree (seriously, that's essential)
* [x] Make impossible to use `SGDC_SIMPLE_DATATYPE` more than once
* [ ] Add usable documentation (possibly generated from comments in source code)
* [ ] Add an option for bintree to count subnodes
* [ ] Add an option for data structures to hold `T*` rather than `T`. That will ease using data structures with pointers (no manual allocation and freeing)
* [ ] Add more different data structures
  * [x] Single-linked list
  * [ ] Double-linked list
  * [ ] Stack
  * [ ] Red-black tree
  * [ ] AVL tree
  * _And others_
* [ ] Add iterators for data structures
  * [ ] Binary tree
  * [x] Single-linked list
  * [ ] Double-linked list
